# Firebase Authentication Project with Hashnode Blog

This project provides an example of how to implement Firebase Authentication in your Android app. It's meant to accompany a blog post on Hashnode, where you can follow along with the code and see the authentication process in action.

# Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
````
git clone https://github.com/Krish-Parekh/Firebase-Auth-Blog.git
````

2. Include your `google-services.json` file in the `app` directory. This file is generated when you set up Firebase for your project. If you haven't done this yet, you can follow the steps outlined in the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup).
